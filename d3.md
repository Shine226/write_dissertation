Recently, I studied d3 systematically based on [Curran Kelleher’s course video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3NF8ez95w&list=PL9yYRbwpkykvOXrZumtZWbuaXWHvjD8gi) and reread the paper: D³ data-driven documents [1]. Based on the study, I rethinking how to design a visualization system and how to reconstruct our Wiggum system.  

Curran starts the courses from the introduction to Javascript. The Javascript is using ECMAScript 6 or ES6 which is a new standard. In the new ES6, a function definition can be a binding where the value is assigned to a function. for example:
```js

    const square = function(x) {
        return x * x;
    };
```
The function can use an arrow (=>) replace the the funciton keyword:
```js

    const square = (x) => x * x;
```
Further simplify will look like:
```js

    const square = x => x * x;
```
Also, if there are multiple statements inside the function, we can use the curly braces to include them:
```js

    const square = x => {
        const result  x * x;
        return result;
    }
```
We will see this new style in the d3 examples often.

Next, Curran talked about SVG scalable vector graphics. SVG encodes every shape as a separate thing and uses group element to group multiple shapes. The effect of SVG is that the image is scalable comparing to JPEG or other image formats. This means no matter how much zoom in, it will not be blurry. When creating different shapes, the attributes can be different, for example, a circle uses **cx/cy** to define the center position, but a rectangel uses **x/y** to allocate its left top corner. The path shape will have default fill color, so it is better to set the fill color to none for visualizing a path.

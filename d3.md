Recently, I studied d3 systematically based on [Curran Kelleher’s course video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3NF8ez95w&list=PL9yYRbwpkykvOXrZumtZWbuaXWHvjD8gi) and reread the paper: D³ data-driven documents [1]. Based on the study, I rethinking how to design a visualization system and how to reconstruct our Wiggum system.  

Curran starts the courses from the introduction to Javascript. The Javascript is using ECMAScript 6 or ES6 which is a new standard. In the new ES6, a function definition can be a binding where the value is assigned to a function. for example:
```js

    const square = function(x) {
        return x * x;
    };
```
We starts from historical bias. I showed a result from searching CEO in google to bring the discussion. Should the result reflect the actual women CEO proportion? Different opinions from different people. Before we go through representation bias, the disproportion of the data was aware in this moment. I used two figures showing the distribution of the image data kept in different countries [2]. People are surprised about those disproportion situation.

![](/img/1*DK7ycjXqABjpup8h3K0TbQ.png)Measurement bias are choosing and measuring the data feature of interest, and aggregation bias arises when we can not find a one-size-fit-all model. We also discuss about the benchmark data set for the evaluation bias and realized that the benchmark dataset may not split equally for different subgroups.

I also show our group the mapping figure in ML pipeline. Now we can have a common language to discuss about bias in the ML process.

Recently, I studied d3 systematically based on [Curran Kelleher’s course video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3NF8ez95w&list=PL9yYRbwpkykvOXrZumtZWbuaXWHvjD8gi) and reread the paper: D³ data-driven documents [1]. Based on the study, I rethinking how to design a visualization system and how to reconstruct our Wiggum system.  

Curran starts the courses from the introduction to Javascript. The Javascript is using ECMAScript 6 or ES6 which is a new standard. In the new ES6, a function definition can be a binding where the value is assigned to a function. for example:
```js

    const square = function(x) {
        return x * x;
    };
```
The function can use an arrow (=>) replace the the funciton keyword:
```js

    const square = (x) => x * x;
```
Further simplify will look like:
```js

    const square = x => x * x;
```
Also, if there are multiple statements inside the function, we can use the curly braces to include them:
```js

    const square = x => {
        const result  x * x;
        return result;
    }
```
We will see this new style in the d3 examples often.

Next, Curran talked about SVG scalable vector graphics. SVG encodes every shape as a separate thing and uses group element to group multiple shapes. The effect of SVG is that the image is scalable comparing to JPEG or other image formats. This means no matter how much zoom in, it will not be blurry. When creating different shapes, the attributes can be different, for example, a circle uses **cx/cy** to define the center position, but a rectangel uses **x/y** to allocate its left top corner. The path shape will have default fill color, so it is better to set the fill color to none for visualizing a path. 

Third, D3 stands for data-driven documents. It is a javascript library and let us to create visualization in the browser. Curran uses import feature for the function in d3 library:
```js
    import { select, range } from 'd3';
    import { fruitBowl } from './fruitBowl';
```
The good thing for using the import feature is that we can make our code more reusable now. We defined many global variables in wiggum, but those variables are not always used in all files. Now we can import a function or a variable form another file. After reading the csv file, we always see the data converting code using only a **+** to convert string to float, this style is confusing at the begin.
```js
    csv('data.csv').then(data +> {
        d.population = +d.population;
    });
```
D3 data join has three features enter, update, and exit to communicate between data and the dom elements. These features plays an important role for efficient dynamic visualizations. D3 data join looks like figure 1. On one side, there is data which is input data array, and the other side is nodes which are DOM elements. The d3 join deals with three separate cases: **enter**, **update** and **exit**. The **enter** operator will create placeholer nodes for incoming data array, and the **exit** returns elements related to deleted data. The **update** is the case where there exist both DOM elements and data element, and they are correponse to each other already. The **update** selection will not requre to have the key **update** in the code. The later **merge** operator combines **enter** and **update** selection. Scale is also an important feature for visualizaiton. D3 provides multiple scaling functions. We can think about our data domain is the data space and the range in the scaling system is the screen space. Scaling functions let users to match the data space into the screen space.

Last but not least, ES6 introduced clasess to support object-oriented programming that will make the code reusable. We should consider create classes including constructor, initial visualization function and update visualization function. This could avoid redrawing the visualization after some interaction.
```js
    class Scatterplot{
        constructor() {
            this.initialVis();
        }

        initialVis() {
            //initialize
        }

        updateVis() {
            // update
        }
    }
```
A critical task is how to generize each visualization into class. And later the minor difference in the visualization will not make the created class imcompact.

The future work is to apply the techniques above into Wiggum and make Wiggum more powerful.

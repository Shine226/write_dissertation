Recently, I studied d3 systematically based on [Curran Kelleher’s course video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3NF8ez95w&list=PL9yYRbwpkykvOXrZumtZWbuaXWHvjD8gi) and reread the paper: D³ data-driven documents [1]. Based on the study, I rethinking how to design a visualization system and how to reconstruct our Wiggum system.  

Curran starts the courses from the introduction to Javascript. The Javascript is using ECMAScript 6 or ES6 which is a new standard. In the new ES6, a function definition can be a binding where the value is assigned to a function. for example:
```js

    const square = function(x) {
        return x * x;
    };
```
The function can use an arrow (=>) replace the the funciton keyword:
```js

    const square = (x) => x * x;
```
Further simplify will look like:
```js

    const square = x => x * x;
```
Also, if there are multiple statements inside the function, we can use the curly braces to include them:
```js

    const square = x => {
        const result  x * x;
        return result;
    }
```
We will see this new style in the d3 examples often.
